# Hosted UI tests

`.github/workflows/ui-tests.yml` runs the scripted UI suite (`ios/UITests`) on
standard GitHub-hosted `macos-26` runners. Before it, every UI run waited on the
one build Mac, where all simulator work shares one lock (about an hour's queue
per run on 2026-11-11 with six lanes active).

- **When:** every pull request, and on demand (`workflow_dispatch`, optional
  `only` input naming UITest classes).
- **How:** a planning job lists `ios/UITests/*UITests.swift` and splits the
  classes round-robin into up to 4 shards. Each shard builds for testing
  (unsigned) and runs its classes on one hosted iPhone simulator. A failing
  shard uploads its `.xcresult` for 7 days.
- **Stays on the build Mac:** classes that drive the simulator through the private
  content-size runner (`scripts/sim-content-size-runner.sh` in the release repo):
  `GScrollDynamicTypeUITests`, `S1MatrixUITests`, `S6SystemUITests`,
  `TranscriptUITests`. Also `KitBoardCaptureUITests`, which captures evidence and
  is not a check. They are listed in `LOCAL_ONLY` in the workflow.
- **Not a required check** yet. Make it required once it has been green on
  `main` for a few runs.
- No secrets, signing or uploads beyond failure result bundles. Actions are pinned
  by SHA.

Run one class against a branch:
`gh workflow run ui-tests.yml --ref <branch> -f only="ChatPanelUITests"`
